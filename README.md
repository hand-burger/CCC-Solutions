# CCC-Solutions

Archive of past and recent Canadian Computing Contest solutions. All solutions are written in Python 3. I'm open to new contributions and suggestions on the solutions I've already uploaded.

All Past Contests are available <a href='https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc'>here</a>

Unless I continue this over the Grade 12 school year, chances are this will never be finished, but oh well.
