# CCC-Solutions
Archive of past and recent Canadian Computing Contest solutions. All solutions are written by myself in Python 3 unless otherwise stated in the file. I'm open to new contributions and suggestions on the solutions I've already uploaded.

All Past Contests are available <a href='https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc'>here</a>

As of now (07/2021), a vast majority of the solutions are blank python files. I've finished 2007 junior solutions and I'm almost done 1996.

Unless I continue this over the Grade 12 school year, chances are this will never be finished, but oh well.
